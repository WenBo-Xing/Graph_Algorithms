# Graph Algorithms Visualizer ðŸŽ¯

This project is a visual interactive tool built with Python and Tkinter to demonstrate two fundamental graph algorithms:

- **Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm**
- **Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm**

Each algorithm's process is animated and saved as a `.gif` file for better understanding and step-by-step visualization.

---

## ðŸ§  Features

- âœ… Input custom weighted undirected graphs using adjacency list format.
- âœ… Visualize Dijkstra and Prim step-by-step as animated `.gif` files.
- âœ… Save each animation with auto-incrementing filenames.
- âœ… GUI built with Tkinter for:
  - Inputting graph edges
  - Selecting a start node
  - Choosing fringe type (Binary Heap or Linked List)
  - Incrementally adding edges
- âœ… Automatically display the animation result in a popup window.
- âœ… Support for both binary heap and linked list fringe implementations.

---
Enter the graph edges in the format:
Start node:A
A B 1
A C 2
B D 6
C E 5
D F 1
E F 4
A F 3
C D 2

---
And add  the edge:
B E 6
